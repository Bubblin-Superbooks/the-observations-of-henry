<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> There was one girl&mdash;a weird-looking creature, with red eyes and long thin hands, that gave you the creeps to look at. She'd come in regular with her young man, a pale-faced nervous sort of chap, at three o'clock every afternoon. Theirs was the funniest love-making I ever saw. She'd pinch him under the table, and run pins into him, and he'd sit with his eyes glued on her as if she'd been a steaming dish of steak and onions and he a starving beggar the other side of the window. A strange story that was&mdash;as I came to learn it later on. I'll tell you that, one day.</p><p>I'd been engaged for the &ldquo;heavy work,&rdquo; but as the heaviest order I ever heard given there was for a cold ham and chicken, which I had to slip out for to the nearest cook-shop, I must have been chiefly useful from an ornamental point of view.</p></div> </div>
