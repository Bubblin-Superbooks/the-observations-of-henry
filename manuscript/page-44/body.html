<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;I suppose you'll be bossing that bar in Capetown now before long?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Talk sense,&rdquo; she answers. &ldquo;How can the Marchioness of Appleford marry a hotel keeper?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why not,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;if she fancies him? What's the good of being a Marchioness if you can't do what you like?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That's just it,&rdquo; she snaps out; &ldquo;you can't. It would not be doing the straight thing by the family. No,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;I've spent their money, and I'm spending it now. They don't love me, but they shan't say as I have disgraced them. They've got their feelings same as I've got mine.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
