<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Don't you fret yourself about that,&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;You'll see a good deal of that child before you've done with it. Babies ain't the sort of things as gets lost easily. It's only on the stage that folks ever have any particular use for other people's children. I've known some bad characters in my time, but I'd have trusted the worst of 'em with a wagon-load of other people's kids. Don't you flatter yourself you're going to lose it! Whoever's got it, you take it from me, his idea is to do the honest thing, and never rest till he's succeeded in returning it to the rightful owner.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
