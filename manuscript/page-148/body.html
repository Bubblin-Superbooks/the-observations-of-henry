'I was earning my living before I married you, and I can earn it again. You go your way, I go mine.'</p><p>&ldquo;It didn't satisfy him; but there was nothing else to be done, and there was no moving her now in any other direction whatever, even had he wanted to. He offered her anything in the way of money&mdash;he wasn't a mean chap,&mdash;but she wouldn't touch a penny. She had kept her old clothes&mdash;I'm not sure that some idea of needing them hadn't always been in her head,&mdash;applied for a place under her former manager, who was then bossing a hotel in Kensington, and got it. And there was an end of high life so far as she was concerned.</p></div> </div>
