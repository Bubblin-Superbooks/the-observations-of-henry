<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>My first place&mdash;well to be honest, it was a coffee shop in the Mile End Road&mdash;I'm not ashamed of it. We all have our beginnings. Young &ldquo;Kipper,&rdquo; as we called him&mdash;he had no name of his own, not that he knew of anyhow, and that seemed to fit him down to the ground&mdash;had fixed his pitch just outside, between our door and the music hall at the corner; and sometimes, when I might happen to have a bit on, I'd get a paper from him, and pay him for it, when the governor was not about, with a mug of coffee, and odds and ends that the other customers had left on their plates&mdash;an arrangement that suited both of us.</p></div> </div>
