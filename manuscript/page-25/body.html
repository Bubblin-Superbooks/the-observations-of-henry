<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I'd been there about a fortnight, and was feeling pretty sick of it, when in walked young &ldquo;Kipper.&rdquo; I didn't know him at first, he'd changed so. He was swinging a silver-mounted crutch stick, which was the kind that was fashionable just then, and was dressed in a showy check suit and a white hat. But the thing that struck me most was his gloves. I suppose I hadn't improved quite so much myself, for he knew me in a moment, and held out his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;What, 'Enery!&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;you've moved on, then!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I says, shaking hands with him, &ldquo;and I could move on again from this shop without feeling sad. But you've got on a bit?&rdquo; I says.</p></div> </div>
