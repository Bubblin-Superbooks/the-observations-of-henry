She wasn't that sort.</p><p>I sat with my eyes coming out of my head till she was close to me, and then I says:</p><p>&ldquo;Carrots!&rdquo; I says, in a whisper like. That was the name that come to me.</p><p>&ldquo;'Carrots' it is,&rdquo; she says, and down she sits just opposite to me, and then she laughs.</p><p>I could not speak, I could not move, I was that took aback, and the more frightened I looked the more she laughed till &ldquo;Kipper&rdquo; comes into the room.
