<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Marie asked to leave that evening at half-past six. I never saw her looking prettier. She called me into the office before she went. She wanted advice. She had in one hand a beautiful opal brooch set in diamonds&mdash;it was what he had given her that morning&mdash;and in her other hand the one of onyx.</p><p>&ldquo;'Shall I wear them both?' asked she, 'or only the one?' She was half laughing, half crying, already.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought for a bit. 'I should wear the onyx to-night,' I said, 'by itself.'&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
