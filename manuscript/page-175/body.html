'Can't begin a good thing too soon,' is, I suppose, their motto.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How did the marriage turn out?&rdquo; was my next question. The married life of a lady and gentleman, the united ages of whom amounted to thirty-two, promised interesting developments.</p><p>&ldquo;Practically speaking,&rdquo; replied Henry, &ldquo;it wasn't a marriage at all. It had been a secret affair from the beginning, as perhaps you can imagine. The old man had other ideas for his daughter, and wasn't the sort of father to be played with. They separated at the church door, intending to meet again in the evening. Two hours later Master Tom Sleight got knocked on the head in a street brawl. If a row was to be had anywhere within walking distance he was the sort of fellow to be in it.</p></div> </div>
