<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Before three months were up she was the rage of London&mdash;leastways of the music-hall part of it&mdash;with her portrait in all the shop windows, and interviews with her in half the newspapers. It seems she was the daughter of an officer who had died in India when she was a baby, and the niece of a bishop somewhere in Australia. He was dead too. There didn't seem to be any of her ancestry as wasn't dead, but they had all been swells. She had been educated privately, she had, by a relative; and had early displayed an aptitude for dancing, though her friends at first had much opposed her going upon the stage. There was a lot more of it&mdash;you know the sort of thing. Of course, she was a connection of one of our best known judges&mdash;they all are&mdash;and she merely acted in order to support a grandmother, or an invalid sister, I forget which. A wonderful talent for swallowing, these newspaper chaps has, some of 'em!</p></div> </div>
