<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It is just the same with what you may call the human joints,&rdquo; observed Henry. He was in one of his philosophic moods that evening. &ldquo;It all depends upon the cooking. I never see a youngster hanging up in the refrigerator, as one may put it, but I says to myself: 'Now I wonder what the cook is going to make of you! Will you be minced and devilled and fricasseed till you are all sauce and no meat? Will you be hammered tender and grilled over a slow fire till you are a blessing to mankind? Or will you be spoilt in the boiling, and come out a stringy rag, an immediate curse, and a permanent injury to those who have got to swallow you?'</p></div> </div>
